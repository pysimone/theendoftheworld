## In the beginning

Put the water and the malt in a pot and boil it for a few billion years.

Add sugar for further enjoyment!

## The appearance of life

Put the wort in a fermeter. It needs to be cooled quickly and oxygenated.

Now it's ready to welcome life.

Inoculate the yeast!

The yeast finds an environment with almost infinite resources and no predators. It begins to reproduce exponentially.

## The end of the world

Yeast erodes all the available resources faster and faster and the environment is filled with waste: alcohol and carbon dioxide.

In a short time the yeast population collapses!

## The beer is ready

Put the beer in a fresh place for some time.

Enjoy!

## Finally

Maybe you are thinking *"Damn, but that's happening to my planet"*.

Don't panic, there is always a [plan B](https://pysimone.github.io/theendoftheworld/planetb).
